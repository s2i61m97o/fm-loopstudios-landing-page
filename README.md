## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

First time I have used a custom hook in React - in this case to get the screen width to dynamically render certain elements and images. I found it easy to understand after having a relatively good understanding of using React hooks. I also looked at different positioning techniques and continued to develop my understanding of responsive design and React projects

### Continued development

I will continue to delve deeper into React and learn more about and improve my skills in Responsive design.
